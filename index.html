    <h1>Introduction to DevOps</h1>
    <p>
        DevOps is a set of practices that brings together software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). 
        It focuses on improving collaboration, automating processes, and delivering software faster and more reliably.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Principles of DevOps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Encourages teamwork between developers and operations staff.</li>
        <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Reduces manual work by automating tasks like testing and deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Integration (CI):</strong> Regularly integrates code changes into a shared repository.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Delivery (CD):</strong> Ensures code is always ready to be deployed to production.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools in DevOps</h2>
    <p>
        DevOps relies on various tools to streamline workflows. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jenkins for automation</li>
        <li>Docker for containerization</li>
        <li>Terraform for infrastructure management</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is Terraform?</h2>
    <p>
        Terraform is an open-source tool by HashiCorp that lets you define and manage infrastructure using code. 
        It works with cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as on-premises systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Terraform in DevOps</h2>
    <p>
        Terraform automates the setup of infrastructure, such as servers and networks, in a repeatable way. 
        This fits into DevOps by enabling teams to treat infrastructure like softwareâ€”versioned, tested, and deployed consistently.
